# Blue-Bank
Tabpy project 2/3
Tabpy project 2/3 from Python and Tableau: The Complete Data Analytics Bootcamp! on Udemy by Dee Naidoo

Loan Analysis for Blue Bank: Weâ€™re also going to be working on a Loan Analysis for a bank. Using Python and Tableau, blue bank wants to see an analysis of people who have taken loans but might have issues paying back. We learn how to read JSON files, work with lists, dictionaries, Numpy and if statements. We also learn how to do exceptions, for loops and plots in Python. Once that's done, we extract the data to Tableau and build charts, work with Tableau Calculations and create an interactive dashboard.
